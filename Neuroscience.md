I study the neural mechanisms of visual perception, decision making, and adaptive behavior.  My research aims to understand processes by which the primate brain integrates diverse types of information (e.g., sensory, rewards, prior beliefs) into a strategy to select appropriate actions and how the strategy can flexibly adapted to  improve performance.  To do this, I use use a sophisticated combination of computational modeling, behavioral studies in humans and nonhuman primates, and neurophysiological recordings from populations of neurons in multiple brain areas.  I use model-based analyses and machine-learning algorithms to accurately predict subject's behavior based on their past history of experience and the observed neural population states.

## Large-scale recordings of neural populations

I am using state-of-the-art techniques to simultaneously record activity from large neural populations from multiple areas of the primate brain.  Electrical signals from hudreds of neurons in the frontal and parietal cortext are recorded at submillisecond resolution in monkeys making decisions based on sensory information and a changing context (stimulus-response-reward contingencies).  I use dimensionality reduction methods to visualize the evolution of neural populations throughout decision formation. I use maching- learning algorithms to decode the information represented in different brain region and to make accurate predictions about the animal's upcoming choices. I study the correlation structure of signals within and across areas to to understand neural interactions over different spatial scales.  In addition, I inject small amounts of electrical current into different areas of the brain to understand how perturbation of the neural population state influences ongoing decision making at the behavioral and neural level. My results from this project will be presented at the [Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting](https://www.sfn.org/annual-meeting/neuroscience-2017) this fall.

## Neural models of decision making

I developed novel computational models of decision making.  My models used neurophysiological activity recorded from macaque monkeys making visually-based decisions as input to simple artificial neural networks.  The models predicted the monkeys's choices and response times and replicated the dynamics of actual neural populations.  I showed how novel model architectures can improve prediction accuracy.   You can find an overview the modeling framework and sample code in the [gated_accumulator_model](https://github.com/purcelba/gated_accumulator_model) repository or read more about the details in the papers listed below.

## Models of adaptive decision making

I combined human psychophysical experiments, computational models of behavior, and neurophysiological recordings from behaving macaque monkeys to understand how we adapt our decision strategies following mistakes. I fit models of choice and reaction time to human and monkey behavior and used the optimized model parameters to make inferences about the underlying neural mechanisms. To test the model predictions, I analyzed neural dynamics recorded from the parietal cortex of monkeys trained to perform a simple perceptual decision-making task. I found that our visual sensitivity drops following errors, but our brains can compensate by adaptively slowing down the subsequent choice. You can read more about it in the following paper or check out some of the popular press on the article.

I developed a new behavioral model to study how the brain flexible changes the decision strategy in a dynamic environment.  When our choices produce negative outcomes, we need to decide whether the error was the result of poor information or a bad strategy.  To optimally decide when the strategy must change, we should treat negative outcomes as evidence for a change of strategy and scale it by our decision confidence.  I implemented this approach in a mathematical model and conducted a human behavioral experiment to test its predictions. I show that the model accurately predicts human behavior and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms plausible alternatives.

## Neurophysiological representations of visual salience

I recorded activity from neurons in medial and lateral frontal cortex of monkeys trained to perform a visual search task in which they located a target item among distractors (e.g., red circle among green circles).  I used ROC curves and other analyses to quantify the information about object identity carried by individual neurons.  I found that lateral frontal cortex robustly represents the location of the target, but medial frontal corext did not.  Instead, medial frontal cortex seems to play a distinct role in signaling positive and negative feedback.

I analyzed the trial-by-trial variance of neural activity in lateral prefrontal cortex during visual search. I found that changing the behavioral significance of the object in a cell's response field has little effect on the neural variance.  Instead, neural variance decreased before eye movements, consistent with convergence of neural populations to a fixed state to trigger shifts of gaze.

## Homologous neural mechanisms of visual attention and working memory in humans and non-human primates

I collaborated with Goeff Woodman to conduct two studies of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals - brain activity recorded from the surface of the head in humans that can be used to index cognitive states.  My work helped to establish a non-human primate model of EEG components associated with visual attention and working memory.  By pairing EEG from outside the skull with recordings of neural activity from inside the brain, we could study how neural populations give rise to observed EEG.  My work showed how frontal cortex indirectly contributes to the generation of attention- and memory-related EEG signals.  You can read more about this work in the papers below or check out [Geoff's website](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/woodman/) for more information about his awesome work.

## Evaluating methods for measuring and visualizing human similarity judgments

As an undergraduate, I evaluated methods for visualizing the structure of human categorization of colors and personality traits.   I collected human similarity judgments of color and personality trait stimuli using a "sort-and-merge" procedure in which subjects grouped stimuli into clusters based on their perceived similarity and subsequently merged the clusters based their overall group similarity.  I visualized the resulting similarity structure using an multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedrue.  I assessed the internal validity of the procedure using percent variance explained.  I evaluated the external validity of the procedure by comparing the shape of the solution to "ground truth" dataset obtained using pairwise similarity judgments for the same stimuli.   I found that the sort-and-merge procedure could capture the structure of judgments quite well, establishing it as a cheaper and less time-consuming alternative to pairwise judgments for measuring human categorization.
