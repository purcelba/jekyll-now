I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.  My research combines computational modeling, behavioral experiments, and electrophysiology to study neural mechanisms of decision making.  

I completed my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Vanderbilt Unversity and studied cognitive science with minors in applied statistics and neuroscience at Miami University. Please check out the [Neuroscience](https://purcelba.github.io/Neuroscience/) page to read about my research.

In addition to research, I developed a web application that models NYC rental prices and participate in predictive modeling competitions.  Please check out the [Blog](https://purcelba.github.io/) to read about these projects.
