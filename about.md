I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.  My research combines computational modeling, psychophysics, and electrophysiology to study neural mechanisms of decision making.  I previously completed my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Vanderbilt Unversity working with Drs. Thomas Palmeri and Jeffrey Schall and studied cognitive science with a focus on statistics and neuroscience at Miami University. Please check out the [Neuroscience](https://purcelba.github.io/Neuroscience/) page to read more about my neuroscience research.

My work is supported by a [Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-collaboration-on-the-global-brain-scientific-mission/).
