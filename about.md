I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.  My research in Roozbeh Kiani's lab combines computational modeling, behavioral studies, and electrophysiology to study neural mechanisms of decision making.  Please check out the [Neuroscience](link) page to read more about my neuroscience research.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Vanderbilt Unversity working with Drs. Thomas Palmeri and Jeffrey Schall and studied cognitive psychology with a focus on statistics and neuroscience at Miami University.

My work is supported by a [Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-collaboration-on-the-global-brain-scientific-mission/).
